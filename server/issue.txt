Alright — here’s a clean breakdown you can use for your document.

## **Issue: Socket.IO Session Mismatch After Login**

### **Problem**

The socket connection was being created **immediately** when the React app loaded:

const socket = io('http://localhost:1509', { withCredentials: true });

This happened **before** the user logged in.

As a result:

* **Socket session A** was created first — it had **no `user` data** in the session and an earlier `_expires` time.
* **HTTP session B** (created at login) had the `user` data and a later `_expires` time.
* Because sessions were created at different times, expiry times didn’t match and socket didn’t have the user info.

---

### **Cause**

* The socket handshake happens at the moment `io()` is called.
* If you call `io()` before login, the browser has no session cookie yet, so the server can’t attach `user` data to that socket’s session.
* Socket.IO won’t magically update its session data just because you logged in later — you must reconnect to send the updated cookie.

---

### **Solution**

**Create the socket only after a successful login**, so the handshake uses the same session and cookie as the HTTP login.

**Steps:**

1. Remove the top-level socket creation from `App.js`.
2. Create a `connectSocket()` function in `App.js` that calls `io()` only when needed.
3. Call `connectSocket()` **after** login success in `Login.js`.
4. Store the socket in React Context so it’s shared across the whole app.

---

**Example Fix:**

**App.js**

```jsx
const [socket, setSocket] = useState(null);

const connectSocket = () => {
  if (!socket) {
    const newSocket = io('http://localhost:1509', { withCredentials: true });
    setSocket(newSocket);
  }
};

<Route path="/" element={<Login connectSocket={connectSocket} />} />
```

**Login.js**

```jsx
if (res.ok) {
  connectSocket(); // Connect socket AFTER login success
  navigate('/page2');
}
```

---

### **Result**

* Both HTTP and Socket.IO now share the same session and expiry.
* `req.session.user` is available inside both HTTP routes and Socket.IO event handlers immediately after login.
* No duplicate sessions, no mismatched `_expires`.

I can also add a **timeline diagram** to your document so the “before vs after” is super clear.
Do you want me to make that?


----------------------------------------------------------- ISSUE 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

window.monaco → this is the global Monaco library.
It gets loaded once via the script.
It persists in the browser, even if you navigate away.
editorRef.current → this is the editor instance created inside your component.

It is tied to the DOM element (containerRef).

You dispose it on unmount, which removes it from the DOM.

The issue:

When you navigate away, editorRef.current.dispose() runs → editor disappears.

When you come back, window.monaco already exists → your code skips creating a new editor instance → so you see only “Loading Editor…” and no editor.
